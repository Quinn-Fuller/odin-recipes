        <h2>An amazing peach cobbler</h2>
        <p>An old fashion recipe from a collection of my mother's favorites. With a dash of nutmeg the aroma will take you back to grandma's kitchen.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 large peaches, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pour butter into an 8-inch square baking dish. </li>
            <li>Combine peaches and 3/4 cup sugar together in a bowl. Whisk flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl; stir in milk just until batter is combined. Pour batter over butter and top with peaches. </li>
            <li> Bake in the preheated oven until cobbler is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. </li>
        </ol>
