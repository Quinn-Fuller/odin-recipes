        <h2>Delicous Blueberry Muffins</h2>
        <p>This blueberry muffin recipe is moist, sweet, and bursting with fruity flavor. A buttery streusel topping takes this indulgent breakfast over the top. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>For the muffins</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>⅓ cup milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Crumb topping</p>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, cubed</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with paper liners. </li>
            <li>For the muffins: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. </li>
            <li>Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark; stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries; set batter aside. </li>
            <li>For the crumb topping: Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly. </li>
            <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top. Sprinkle with crumb topping. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p> If using a 12-cup muffin pan, you will have 4 empty cups. Add 1 tablespoon of water to the empty cup spaces when baking. Muffins tend to burn faster in a pan with empty cups.

            These muffins are best served with homemade butter. </p>
