# odin-recipes
A test page for recipes, a project done through TOP.

 A project for TOP it was an interesting but ultimately very easy project I could have added a couple extra things but overall I feel the main takeaway for this project was just simply getting used to the feel of the process and not going crazy indepth later projects will cover the more advanced things so no need to delve deeply into it right now
